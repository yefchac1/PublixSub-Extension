# This is a Chrome Extension to my PublixSub Bot

##Purpose of Bot:

This bot was created to automatically order my favorite chicken tender sub sandwich in my closest Publix Supermarket with:

*No Lettuce.
*No Tomato.
*Mayo.
*Bbq.
*Extra Ranch.
*Toasted.

It should do everything in less than a 1 minute ✌️

Originally, the bot was created in Python with Selenium, but I wanted to make it a Chrome Extension, so I switched to Puppeteer to reach my goal.
